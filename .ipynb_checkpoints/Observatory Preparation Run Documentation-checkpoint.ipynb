    ">  **INPUT** The input is The input to the main function is acquired by '.json' files which comprise of the follwoing input functions - <br>\n",
    "i) `constraints.json` - Includes upper value of Airmass, Altitude and moon seperation and lower acceptable value of minimum altitude. It also states the start and end time of the observation period. <br>\n",
    "ii)`date_and_time.json`- Houses information of current date and time. If customised time is required it can also be input. <br>\n",
    "iii)`observatory.json` - Houses information about name, description, latitude, longitude, elevation and timezone of the observatory. <br>\n",
    "iv) `target.json`- Stores names of targets in an array format of string type. <br>\n",
    "Another program `parse_input.py` converts the .json files into pyhton acceptable input and calculates and fetches various values. <br>\n",
    "> **OUTPUT** The output is generated as a '.csv' format in two sheets. The outputs are -    <br>\n",
    "i)`observer_info.csv` - Showcases the date and time of nearest Sunset Time, Evening Twilight, Midnight Time, Morning Twilight Time and Sunrise Time in a table format.   <br>\n",
